# Media-Manager
<p>This is a C++ terminal program that allows the user to enter their recently watched movies, along with the movie's release year, genre, and a personal rating. Once the list is created, it is saved in a local .txt file on the user's computer. The user can then view their list, add to it, or replace it entirely.</p>
